# HTML Input Type SerialNumber
A new type of Input field in HTML which is specially built for Serial Numbers.
## Pattern Matching
Serial Numbers consist of multiple pieces, each having a separate set of allowed characters. This type of an Input box checks each piece separately, instead of all at once, for allowed characters mentioned by the programmer using Regular Expression.
## Separators
Some Serial Numbers have separating characters, such as dashes, between the pieces. This input automatically puts those separators where required.
