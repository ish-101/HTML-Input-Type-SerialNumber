# HTML Input Type SerialNumber
A new type of HTML Input field which is specially built for Serial Numbers. It doesn't let the user input a wrongly-formatted Serial Number.
## _LIVE_ Pattern Matching and Auto Completion
### Pattern Matching
It test for the Regular Expression separately on separate pieces of the input, instead of all at once. The invalid characters automatically get deleted.
### Auto Completion
Some Serial Numbers have separating characters, such as dashes, between the pieces. This input field automatically adds those separators wherever required.
Since both these features LIVE, this software _assists_ the user while filling out the Serial Number, instead of simply pointing out that it was wrong.
